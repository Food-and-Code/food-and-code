  bio: Dandy catwoman over which Batman has no power. Promised as curator of the year by The Time in 2020 (we'll be there to check), Alicia makes good use of her 9 lives, which still doesn't explain how she has time to do all she does. Coaching our dear kittens, putting her scenography skills to good use, dancing all night long, count on her to embody the spirit of F&C from dawn to dawn.

  bio: I am a PhD student at IRIDIA (Belgium) in artificial intelligence and works in parallel as a technological artist. I've been highly interested in the writing of code as a creative process and the liberty that emerges when a programming language is seen as any other language. I've been working my fair share on gesture and its visualisation, as well as new kinds of interaction. Always eager to work on new projects, hit me up!
