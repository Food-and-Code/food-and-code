  bio: Dandy catwoman over which Batman has no power. Promised as curator of the year by The Time in 2020 (we'll be there to check), Alicia makes good use of her 9 lives, which still doesn't explain how she has time to do all she does. Coaching our dear kittens, putting her scenography skills to good use, dancing all night long, count on her to embody the spirit of F&C from dawn to dawn.
