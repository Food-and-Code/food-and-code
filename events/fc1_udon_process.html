                        A lot can happen when you already have a kick ass location. After too much working at KollBoll in Lyon, Jeremie Cortial and Roman Miletitch had the idea to mix bits of food and delicious code. This one-shot-not-one-shot event spawn all the goodness. On the menu this time, hand kneaded noodles and japanese stock cooked with love by Adrien Couz and Nao, served in the Yatai Chienpo. A good occasion to eat food while watching what was created during the day in our amazing workshop. From zero to hero, our workshopers experimented with code for the first time, and it's pretty amazing to see what can be done in a day!
