                        Yep, one-shot not one-shot. By popular request, Food&Code rises from the bbq ashes and comes back to life. We'll start this time with a Processing workshop during the morning, strong from the experimental course we had for the previous precious event. Always amazing to see what can be achieved by people that just discovered coding. Mind over-cooked.

                        But F&C wouldn't be what it is without the food. We stay in the land of the rising sun, but present something less famous (for reasons unknown to Jeremie and me): japanese cabbage pancakes, okonomiyaki. Delicious. To kill for. No injuries reported.

                        As always, our trusty street food stand was there, augmented by our kittens during the day. Both code and okonomiyaki grilled on the plancha and serve hot, mixed with some sound from <a href="http://facebook.com/abuclier">Arthur Buclier</a>.
