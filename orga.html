                        <p>So, curious on the inner mechanism of F&C? Eager to organise one on your own? You're in the right place. While we're accumulating docs on the side to document our work on F&C, we will over time clean them up and shae them with the world here. In the end, this will grow into a tutorial on how to organise a F&C from start to finish.
                        </p>

                        <p>In the meanwhile, if you have questions, if you want to organise one, if you want one organised in your city... Be sure to contact us!
