						<h3>What We Do</h3>
                        <p>
                        F&C celebrates the most important unit of time, the biggest between two deaths: the day. It's easy to forget how much one can do and change during one day. In our case, morning is for discovering & (re)learning basics of creative coding. At noon comes a little lunch break to cook, release our brain muscles, feed and get some inspiration from food and newly acquired skills. Then the real deal start: mix, mash, smash, decreate, change point of view & clothes alike... release your inner process, rediscover it, let it free and create. Digital art, food, both, anything. Just feel it & make it yours. Last, shine & party: a special exhibit open to the world starts during the evening and evolves at night time into a party where food, music, dancing and creation fuse.
                        </p>

					    <h3>Our Aim</h3>
                        <p>
                        One of our aim is to play down the angst of living and creating and to bring back freedom and joy in the life/creative process. F&C is a shamanic sanctuary with creation as its totem and where trial & errors are encouraged. Aim high but start low: open your cupboard and create with what you have. Skills are useful but never necessary. Be messy, let yourself experiment the carnal physicality of both of our medium: cooking and coding.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Through this global approach of creation, we expect to reveal individuals, especially creators. We aim at making them emerge not only through discussion but also through experiencing; would that be coding, cooking, developing their sensibility to various medium, researching their taste...
                        </p>

					    <h3>What We Are</h3>
                        <p>
                        This is Food&Code, an event from workshop to exhibition that mixes digital art and cooking sensibility over the span of day. F&C is two bullets for one gun: one straight to the guts with food to touch, mix and taste; the other straight to the brain with code to imagine, mix and expose. F&C is the reunion of both, food & code -meant to be mixed- and body & mind -should never have been separated-.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Curious about the concept? Eager to participate or co-organise a Food&Code event? Be sure to send us a message, we'll be delighted to hear from you.
